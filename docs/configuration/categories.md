# Create a category

Before your members can start making tickets you need to create a ticket category. This is done with the `/settings` command.

Type `/settings categories create` to create a new category. You need to copy the ID of one or more roles for the category's staff roles.

Use  `/settings categories edit` to modify the category's options, such as the channel name format, opening message text, and if ticket claiming should be enabled.

Members can now create tickets with `/new` and you can [create a panel](../panels).

!!! info
	The `/settings` command can also be used to change the bot's locale (language), embed colours, and to enable optional features such as the close ticket button. Type `/settings set` to see all of the options.
	
Useful Tips
	When using `/settings categories edit` to modify the category's options - Specifically the `opening_questions` please ensure you are using the following format `opening_questions: ["q1", "q2"]`
